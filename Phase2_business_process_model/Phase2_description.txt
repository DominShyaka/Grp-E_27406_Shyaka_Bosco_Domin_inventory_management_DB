**Title: Process of Managing Inventory**  

This diagram shows the flow of the retail store inventory management process. It captures the operational processes of a store that utilizes a Management Information System (MIS) for more effective stock management.  

An employee scans an item and the system records the sale. Next, the system updates stock quantity and determines whether it needs re-ordering. If there are sufficient stock levels, the system updates sufficiency records and proceeds to end.  

When stock levels are low, the system notifies the manager. After reviewing the stock, the manager decides to directly approve a reorder. An order is created for the supplier. A supplier is responsible for distributing the products and once supplied, the products are received and the system inventory is updated once more.  

The FLO provided by the MIS helps the store assist in:  

- Decreasing stockouts and overstock situations  

- All automated alerts and approvals  

- Streamlined decision making  

- Optimized inventory levels   
  
Human logic along with system logic can automatically update the database and alert the required personnel in real-time which improves operational decisions timely decision in a process.  

By blending these approaches, operational performance is greatly improved.
