  Key Entities / Actors
Actor ------------> Department	Role
Employee---------->	Records sales and updates stock
Manager----------->	Monitors inventory, approves reorders
Supplier---------->	Provides products for replenishment
System (Inventory DB)-------->	Tracks stock levels, triggers alerts

The inventory management process ensures real-time tracking of products sold and
alerts the manager when stock falls below a threshold. Employees record sales, 
which updates the system. When low stock is detected, the system notifies the manager,
who reviews and approves reordering. Once suppliers deliver goods, 
the stock is updated. This process improves decision-making, avoids overstock/understock situations, 
and ensures smooth operationsâ€”all core goals of a Management Information System (MIS).
