Normalization Notes (3NF)

First Normal Form (1NF)

Atomic (indivisible) values exist only in attributes within tables. 

Every table is free of duplicating groups and multi-valued fields.

Second Normal Form (2NF)

Every non-key attribute is fully functionally dependent on primary key in its entirety. 

Since all tables possess single-attribute primary keys, the problem of partial dependency is nonexistent.

Third Normal Form (3NF)

No transitive dependencies exist.

Non-key attributes are only dependent upon the primary key and not other non-key attributes.

Table Justifications

Products (product_id PK)

→ product_name, category, price, stock_qty

✔ All attributes are fully dependent on product_id and describe the product.

Suppliers (supplier_id PK)

→ supplier_name, contact_info, address

✔ All supported attributes describe the supplier and depend on the supplier_id.

Orders (order_id PK)

→ product_id (FK), supplier_id (FK]), order_date, quantity

✔ Each order is uniquely accompanied by order_id, and all attributes are directly related.

Users (user_id PK)

→ name, username, password, role

✔ Each user’s credentials and role are tied directly to their user_id.

Sales (sale_id PK)

→ product_id (FK), user_id (FK), sale_date, quantity_sold, total_price 

✔ Each sale record, sale_id is record’s identifier completely dependent.
